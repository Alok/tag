![revolv++](tag.gif)

**tag** is a lightweight wrapper around **[ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)** that generates shell aliases for **ag** matches.

tag is a Golang rewrite of [sack](https://github.com/sampson-chen/sack). Currently, it only supports ag. Support for grep and ack may be added in the future.
